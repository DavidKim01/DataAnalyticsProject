            <div>The goal of this project is to minimize the injuries and deaths occurring due to vehicle collisions in
                New York City. The business problem here is to reduce the injuries and deaths due to vehicle collisions.
                We reduce this business problem into data mining problem by hypothesizing that the population of an area
                has a major say in determining the said injuries and deaths. We measure the impact population has on
                vehicle related deaths and injuries and extract a predictive value out of it.</div>

            1. Run linear regression to see which variables has the most impact on collision.<br>
            2. Determine highly-influence factors from the variables that caused the collision.<br>

            database that equates zip codes with their population. For this, we use Demographic Statistics by Zip Code
            database found in NYC Open Data website.

            The form of data mining used is supervised data mining. Our target field is labelled, and we know exactly
            what outcome we are trying to achieve. We use population of an area to predict the number of
            collision-related injuries and deaths in that area. Hence, we are utilizing predictive modelling.<br><br>
            In the project, we use linear regression model for predictive modelling. For this, we use a sum of the
            number of injuries and the number of deaths by zip codes as the dependent variable (y), and we use
            population of the zip codes as the independent variable (x).
